After years of making it big in the stock market, years of wild parties, and years of living the city life, he packs up and moves to rural Montana. He's sick of the busy city, so he picks a very remote house in a very secluded rural area. His closest neighbor is 3 miles away, and his mail/groceries are delivered once a week. He never has to see anyone again.He spends his time reading books, enjoying the nature, and in general enjoying his time alone. One day his doorbell rings, and he opens his door to a large, rough looking man. The man let's him know that his name is Lars, and he's his neighbor from about 5-6 miles up the road. He's having a party on Saturday, and the man is invited. ""This sounds great!"" the man thinks to himself. ""I've been here alone these past few months, and I'm starting to get a little lonely. Meeting the rest of the neighbors sounds like a pretty good time.""He says yes, and Lars is very happy to hear so. Before he goes, Lars gives him a warning: ""Just so you know, there's probably going to be some poker or other card games. I don't know how you feel about gambling, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" The man, having gone to a weekly guys poker night in his life in NYC, says he's totally fine with it. Lars speaks up again: ""Also, there's probably going to be some drinking. Lots of drinking. I don't know how you feel about alcohol, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" The man hasn't been drunk much since he left NYC, thinks it'll be a great change of pace, and says that sounds good!Lars speaks up one last time: ""There's a good chance there's going to be a lot of sex. These parties can get a little out of hand. I don't know how you feel about orgies, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" After his wild life in NYC, the man is no stranger to wild sexual experiences, and after several months of no sex, he agrees.Lars seems pleased, and turns to leave.The man stops him and asks: ""Wait, you forgot to tell me what time on Saturday.""Lars replies: ""You can swing by anytime you want. It's just going to be the two of us.""",0

The restaurant wasn't really full yet because it was just before 11am but they were hungry from the long drive. Their were only 2 middle aged men sitting at a table in the corner of the room. They were wearing overalls that were dirty and they probably had 10 teeth between the both of them. Excited to try the food, the young rich couple got a little of everything but was most excited to try the fried chicken. While the wife is taking a picture of her food, her husband begins to choke on a chicken bone. The wife freaks out and starts screaming for someone to help. The two hillbillies in the corner calmly stand up, walk over to the couple and one man unbuckles is overalls, pulls them down and bends over the table next to the couple. The other hillbilly gets on his knees and starts licking the other hillbilly's asshole. All of a sudden the husband begins to gag as he sees a man licking another man's asshole.

The waiter replied, ""I am so sorry senor. There is only one serving per day because there is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early tomorrow and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy!"" The next morning, the American returned, placed his order, and then that evening he was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, and inspecting the contents of his platter, he called to the waiter and said, ""These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday!""

She was a quick learner.A few weeks in, she could hit the stationary targets surprisingly well, so I decided to step it up a notch earlier than expected:""We're going to move on to moving targets. Now, the key thing to remember with moving targets is that as soon as you see the target in your aim, you have to shoot immediately.

I found myself starting to fall in love with her.The next week, I took her to the woods where to have her practice on wild animals as living targets. Just as expected, she picked it up almost instantly. It seemed like every single shot she took always hit her target. Honestly, at this point I think she ever surpassed my abilities! At this point, there was no doubt in my mind. I was madly in love with her!That night I asked her out on a date. She said to me:""If you had asked me that when I first met you, I would say yes in a heartbeat! But after all this time, after all you've taught me...

As he sat down at one end of the bar the bartender walks over to him and asks what he would like to drink.""Beer"" says the traveling cowboy.""Right away"" says the bartender as he makes his way to the tap.As the cowboy watched the bartender fill a clean mug with a crisp lager he noticed a strange shape out of the corner of his eye. He turned his gaze towards it and his eyes widened in surprise as he realized what he was looking at. At the far end of the bar seated in stool sat a full sized horse whose eyes were filled with tears. A large jar filled with an assortment of coins and Bill's sat on the bar next to the horse. Though he was a traveling man and had seen many things over many years this was without a doubt the strangest sight the traveling cowboy had ever seen.The bartender shortly returned with our cowboy's drink and as he sat it on the bench in front of him  the cowboy spoke and asked,""Why is there a full grown horse sitting on that there stool? And why is he crying?""""Well sir"" says the Bartender ""about one year ago this horse walked into this saloon with tears in his eyes, sat down in that very spot and ordered himself a drink. Hasn't moved or done nothin' else since. No one knows why he came in here or where he came from but one thing is for certain. Whatever horrors he witnessed to put him in such a state I would not like to know myself, nor would any man I reckon.""""Well I'll be"" says the Cowboy. ""What's that there jar for?""""A few months after he came some of my regular customers started making bets. Who ever can make that horse to do anything other than sit there and mourn takes the jar and all the money in it.""Upon hearing this the Cowboy shook his head, drained his mug in one gulp, wiped his lips, stood up and walked over to the horse. The bartender watched in surprise as the cowboy sat down next to the horse and whispered in the horses ear. The tears in the horses eyes remained but no longer were they tears of sorrow. The horse erupted in a violent fit of laughter so loud in could be heard from the street outside the saloon. The cowboy, satisfied with his work stood up, grabbed the jar of money, tipped his hat to the bartender (who at this point was in a state of utter disbelief) and walked out the door.A year later the same traveling cowboy walked into the same saloon and sat down in the same spot he had the year prior. As he sat down he turned his gaze to the far side of the bar and quite to his surprise the horse was still there. Another jar had replaced the one he had taken, and the horse was still possessed by a state of violent laughter. ""YOU!"" Yelled the bartender who had just turned and recognized the face of the traveling cowboy. ""You think you can come back into my saloon after what you've done? That horse has not stopped laughing since the day you came in here and made him do so! It's been so disruptive I can't get anyone to come in here besides my regulars, and all they do is bet on that damned horse. Who ever can get him to do anything other than THAT takes the jar and all of its contents.""""Well I'll be."" Says the cowboy as he stood up and slowly walked over to the horse.The bartender watched as the cowboy made his way to the far side of the bar. He watched the cowboy stand in front of the horse with his back facing the bartender. The bartender watched in an almost euphoric state of shock as the horse's laughter stopped. As the cowboy stood there, the horses countenance fell to the same state it was one year prior. Tears welled up in his eyes and he began to weep once again.Satisfied with his work the cowboy grabbed the new jar and again tipped his hat to the bartender as he made his way to the door.""Wait just a goddamn minute!"" The bartender screamed.""I beg your pardon?"" The cowboy replied as he turned and began walking back toward the bar.""Well hell. You come in here one year ago and you say somthing to that horse, which mind you, had not done nothin' but cry and mourn for one year prior to your arrival. Something so goddamn funny that he then cannot do anything but laugh and be disruptive for the next year, driving away all my customers. Then you come in here now and just stand there and he stops!? You put me through all that and you're just gonna walk out of this saloon without so much as a goodbye? Well that don't sit right with me. So I demand that you tell me what you did to that horse to make his laugh and then cry like that.""""I guess I do owe you that bartender."" Says the travelling Cowboy. ""Well a year ago when I came In here and that horse was crying I went up to him and I told him as that my dick was bigger than his."" ""What in the hell are you talking about?"" Says the bartender in a very sarcastic tone. "" You expect me to believe that? Well mr. Big dick cowboy, what did you tell him today to get him to stop?""""I didn't tell him nothin'"" says the cowboy as a grin as big as Texas spread across his face. ""Today I showed him."" ",0

A duck follows them, crouches, then walks through the open door. The midget musicians continue playing as the bartender asks the duck what he wants. The duck says to ask the horse sitting next to him - he looks pretty sad. The horse replies that he wants two shots and to put it on the ducks tab. The duck, offended and broke, decides to play it off by doing a line of cocaine. Once high, he asks why he can’t also do lines of punch.&#x200B;\_\_\_\_&#x200B;&#x200B;1. Two men walk into a bar.

The man pulls out a bottle and tells him to rub it and make a wish. He rubs the bottle, and a puff of smoke pops out and tells him that he can have one wish. So the man thinks and says, ""I wish I had a million bucks."" The genie says, ""OK, go outside, and your wish will be granted."" The man goes outside, but all he finds are ducks filling the sky and roads. He goes back in and tells his friend what happend, and his friend replies, ""I know.

So, Johnny and his girl Sally are going to prom this Saturday. But, before they can go, Johnny needs to make sure they have a perfect night. So, Friday comes, and Johnny goes out to get his tuxedo. When he gets to the tux rental store, there's this ridiculously long line. But he needs the tux, so Johnny waits. And he waits, and waits until finally, he has his tux. Next, he needs a limo. So he goes to the limousine rental shop and finds that there's an even longer line there. But he needs the limo, so he waits. And he waits, and waits, and waits, until finally, he has the limo ordered. Johnny realizes he needs some new kicks, so he stops by a shoe store to get himself some nice shoes. When he goes to pay, he sees the longest line yet. But he needs the shoes, so he waits. And he waits, and waits, and waits, and waits, and waits, until finally, he's got his new shoes. Saturday, Johnny's ready to pick up his girl. He drives over to her house, picks her up, and they head to prom. At the dance, they're having a great time, dancing, playing at the casino, hanging out with friends. Soon, though, Sally gets thirsty, and asks Johnny for a drink. Being the good guy he is, Johnny obliges. So Johnny walks over to the punch table, and what do you know... *there's no punch line*.",0

I guess you'd call it a contest."" Intrigued, the man asks how it works. ""Well, you put $100 in and then you'll win the whole jar if you complete three tasks.""The jar is quite large and full to the brim with what must be thousands of $100 bills. Excited, he asks, ""What are the three tasks?""The bartender says, ""Well, first you have to drink three straight pints of whiskey without throwing up. That's three entire pints, mind you. Most people can't do it."" ""Okay,"" the man says, clearly seeing that this is dangerous but doable, ""what's the second task?""""Through this door, I have a pet alligator, and he has a sore tooth. It's been bothering him for ages. You need to pull his tooth for me.""""Holy shit,"" the man says, ""alright, well, what's the third task?""""My granny lives upstairs, so I can take care of her. She's lonely and hasn't gotten laid in over 30 years. Go upstairs and make her feel young again.""The man thinks very hard about these tasks, then nods his head, takes out a fresh, crisp $100 bill and stuffs it into the jar. The bartender pours the three pints of whiskey, which the man promptly starts drinking. It takes him a minute or so, and he nearly vomits, but manages to keep them down. He then goes through the doorway, stumbling slightly, to the alligator room. An immense howling is soon heard, grunting, scratching, and some of most painful and excruciating sounds the bartender has ever heard. After a few minutes, the man stumbles back through the doorway, looking a little worse for the wear, and says, ""Alright... So, where's that old lady with the sore tooth?""",0

The tribe leader was ecstatic that someone of Asian descent was at his tribe. They quickly exchanged names and the tribe leader offered to give a quick tour of the rain-forest nearby.Sato was amazed at the wildlife diversity and learnt many new things about African flora and fauna. The tribe leader was happy that his guest was enjoying his time.About ten more minutes of walking, they encountered a cave; it was pitch black. Sato tried to make out any figures or objects in the cave but light only shone in about a few meters.""Toot toot toot,"" the tribe leader called out in a deep and nonchalant voice.The tribe leader edged towards the cave and cup his hand around his ear, awaiting a response.""Toot toot toot,"" a slightly higher pitched voice called back.The tribe leader quickly took off all his clothes and dashed into the cave, leaving Sato shocked and confused.About five minutes later, the tribe leader strolled out, sweating all over and panting in exhaustion.""What in the world just happened?!"" Sato asked frantically.The tribe leader laughed as he slowly put on his clothes.""We have a interesting culture here in this area; when you see a cave, you must call out like me and wait for a reply. If you hear reply, it mean that there are a beautiful woman inside wanting to have the sex and you must run in swiftly!""Sato was taken aback; he has never heard anything like it!The next day, he trekked alone into the mountain side and came across a smaller rain-forest where wet leaves littered the ground from a storm that morning.The tribe leader's words echoed in his mind and his curiosity was at an all time high; would the same thing happened?The damp atmosphere was relaxing as he briskly explored the rain-forest, capturing the beautiful African nature around him.Lo and behold, right next to the mountains was an extremely huge cave that stood about two to three times his height.He was exhilarated! A cave this huge must mean many women who could be bustier or more sexually active. He put down his belongings and called out as loud as he could,""Toot toot toot!""He paused and listened.But there was no reply.""Toot toot toot!!""He called even louder.Again, silence.Sato was furious, he refused to be robbed of this golden opportunity. He took a gulp of water and braced for the loudest call of his life.""TOOT TOOT TOOT!""Almost immediately, the cave shrieked back in an extremely solemn voice that was twice as loud.**""TOOT TOOT TOOT!""**Sato was on cloud nine, he tore through his clothes with utmost joy and sprinted into the cave.The next morning, on the front page of the African Daily,**MYSTERY SURROUNDS DEATH OF A NAKED ASIAN MAN ON NORTH-EAST RAILROAD**",0

I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on.The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,""Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.""",0

I turned around to see what is making the noise an i see nothing. I carry on walking but after a while i hear the same noise but even louder. It sounds like someone hitting a wooden fence on the ground. I turn around once more and i see a huge casket, ones you use for bodies during burials, just hopping towards me on the street! &#x200B;I stat to run and that is when i realised, its chasing me. I turn to knock at a nearby house for help, no answer. I see the casket getting closer and closer so i do what anyone would do,  break the door open. I run inside the house, close the door and push against it hoping the casket wont know where i am. However after a few second of silence, BANG BANG BANG. It is trying to break the door down, i retreat to the stairs of the house as i watch to see if it will get in. But then silence, i wonder 'is it gone' however suddenly it crashes through the door! I run up the stairs, watching as it is following me still! I lock myself in the bathroom, i realise i have cornered myself. &#x200B;The casket starts to pound against the door, it was then that i realised i must fight back. So i gather all the items in the bathroom, i grab the toothbrushes to use as little swords against the casket, i empty out the medicine cabinet at my feet to use as throwing weapons. It was at this moment that the banging stopped again, 10 seconds went by, i began to think it had gone away! However, suddenly it bursts through the door! I throw the toothbrushes at it, no good. I throw toilet roll in hopes to trip it up, no good. I look down in panic hoping to find one last hope, when suddenly i spot the cough syrup.I pick the cough syrup, and i throw it at the casket, and yanno what happened?&#x200B;The coffin stopped.&#x200B;im sorry",0

Russia says ""we have a missile that could go into space, go hypersonic, and comeback into Earth and kill our target with maximum efficiency."" Again people start questioning how unbelievable this sounds. Russia then says ""well... It will destroy it's target with a precision of about 7 inches"". The Chinese spokes person comes up with a grin in his face and says ""We have a missile that could go the dark side of the moon, land, collect a sample of the soil and then continue to destroy your country."" Everyone is stunned by this and start questioning the statement. The Chinese finally concede and say ""well... It will land within 3 inches of the target."" Kim Jong-Un, furious that no one is paying attention to him and the fact that he has been completely outdone, screams out ""I have a goat that could give birth through its anus!"" People go wtf is he saying. Even his own people are questioning his statement. The US ask him ""how is this relevant and, even if it were, there is no such thing as a goat giving birth through its anus!"" Kim, knowing that he is on the spot, squirming in his seat and sweating like a horse finally says ""well... Not exactly through its anus, but within a margin of error on 1 inch.""Edit: dry humor.",0

In this garden, Were two little leaves, One covered Adam's, One covered Eve's. As the story goes on, Never the less to say, The wind came along, And blew the leaves away. At the sight, Adam did stare, There was Eve's treasure, All covered with hair. And wonder came, Under Eve's eyes, As Adam's thing, Started to rise. They found a spot, That suited them best, A nice big tree, Where they began to rest. Her legs spread wider, And wider apart, While thrill after thrill, Came into her heart. The head of Adam's thing, Peeked into the hole, And filled her with passion, Beyond her control. Backward and forward, His thing did slide, And Eve's treasure, Was all wet inside. The joy was good, She wouldn't let loose, Until Adam's thing, Was all out of juice. Then down through the years, People did screw, And now it is time, For me and you. So pull down your pants, And lay in the grass, Cause I'm in the mood, For a piece of that ASS! ",0

The hole is pitch-black dark and they debate between themselves, how deep it might be? Quickly, one of them takes out a used bullet shell from his pocket and throws it into the hole. Nothing, they fail to hear it drop. The other hunter notices there's an anvil just by the hole and directs the other to help him lift and throw it into the hole. After considerable effort and at great expense of their backs, they manage to throw the anvil into the hole, but again are disappointed to not hear it hit the bottom. They stand over the hole, with their hands on their knees, squatting over to try and see if there's a bottom. Behind them there's a noise, some sound of trampling leaves and breaking branches in the bush. One hunter quickly grabs the other as a goat seemingly out of nowhere darts between them and straight into the hole. The hunters totally confused decide that it's time to get out of there and call it a day. As they head over to their truck parked on the side of a long narrow road there comes a farmer yelling Becky?? Becky?? and approaches the hunters to ask: ""hey have either of you seen a goat roaming around"". One of the hunters replies: ""Yes, in fact we saw it jump into this hole and points in the direction of the bush where they just came from"". The farmer replies: ""that's impossible, I had her tied an anvil"". \>>>>I heard this joke told by Jay Leno on a podcast deconstructing what makes for an effective joke<<<<&#x200B;",0

She jumps up and down excitedly, but then the genie speaks again.""However, I mush abide by the rules set for me by my creators. Everything I grant you, I grant tenfold to your husband"".Now, the woman hated her husband, but she figured she might as well have a little fun, even if her husband gets better. ""My first wish, my dear genie, is to be the richest woman alive"". The genie snaps his fingers, and it is so.He speaks, ""You do realize that your husband has been given tenfold of what you have received, yes?"" She responds, ""Yes, but he and I are one. What's mine is his and what's his is mine"".She ponders over her second wish, then decides. ""I wish to be the most beautiful woman alive,"" she says. The genie snaps his fingers and it is so, but the husband becomes 10x as handsome as she is pretty. The genie asks, "" Your husband is now far more attractive than you'll ever be, does that not concern you?"" ""No,"" she responds, ""for I am the prettiest woman alive; he will only have eyes for me"".Then, she had an idea. An evil, cunning idea, and a dark smile curled her lips. She looked at the genie, and said, ""I wish for a mild heart attack,"" thinking she could kill her husband and take all that is his. **Her husband received a heart attack 10x as mild as hers.**",0

He reaches back into the bag and pulls out a small piano, setting it on the counter as well. He reaches into the bag once again and pulls out a tiny piano bench. The little man sits down at the piano and starts playing a beautiful piece by Mozart.“Where on earth did you get that ???” asked the surprised bartender. The man responds by reaching into the paper bag. This time he pulls out a magic lamp. He hands it to the bartender and says: “Here. Rub it.”So the bartender rubs the lamp, and suddenly there’s a gust of smoke and a beautiful genie is standing before him. “I will grant you one wish – just one.”The bartender gets real excited. Without hesitating he says, “I want a million bucks !”A few moments later, a duck walks into the bar. Another duck, then another soon follow it. Pretty soon, the entire bar is filled with ducks and they keep coming!The bartender turns to the man and says, “You know, I think your genie’s a little deaf.

They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, ""Greetings, Earthling.  We come in peace. Take us to your leader.""The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.'The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.  Pissed at  the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said gruffly, ""Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace.    Take us to your leader or I will fire!""The older alien again warned his comrade saying,  'You probably don't want to do that! I really think that will make him mad.''Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien.  He aimed his weapon  and opened fire.  There was a huge explosion.  A massive fireball roared towards him and blew the younger alien off his feet and threw him in a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.Half an hour passed. When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien.  'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you never mess with a guy who can loop his pen!s over his shoulder twice and then stick it in his ear.'

Everyone withinmiles just froze in mid action, stirred to the verycore of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.And all the realm realized, instantly, that it wasSam, and Sam was the first person in historyto hit one of the rumored Magical Notes thatmusicians had theorized must exist... yet no onebefore Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.This time, the town below was so impactedthat no one moved, spoke, or even blink forseveral minutes after. As the golden sound finallytapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam hadfound the Second Note...And the next year on Sam's birthday, the townhad realized there was a pattern involved. Thistime, all of the townspeople were present in themonastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hitthe glorious Third Note. People cried out in purepurejoy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.Words cannot do justice to the experience. Thetown flourished, as Sam's notes made the peoplepure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the MagicalNotes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, thatis, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From thestart, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and thisnew sound was not beautiful... it was jarring anddiscordant. Sam started to get very warm, andwas visibly sweating onstage. He doubled hisresolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet partof the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneouslycombusted!

Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered ""nostalgia"" and he got downvoted into oblivion.Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie ""Up"". He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title ""STOLEN"".When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. ""How did you know that would win?"" ""Easy,"" Chris replied. ""Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes.""",1

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.Edit: Thanks for the silver, kind stranger!",1

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",1

Bobby did his business behind a tree and carried on his way. The next day, Bobby was out behind his house again when he saw a swarm of flies circling yesterday's droppings. Intrigued, Bobby dropped his pants and did his business in the exact same spot in hopes of seeing how many flies he could gather. After a couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created a rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use a step ladder to make sure he had a stable poo-pole developing. A curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up. Over the next few days, word of Bobby's droppings had spread around town. It started with just a few people a day coming up to Bobby, punching him in the face, and telling him the errs of his way. It wasn't long until there was a line of over 50 people waiting to see Bobby's poo-pole and to subsequently punch him in the face. The line moved pretty slowly, however, and someone towards the back of the line had to take care of some business of his own. Not wanting to leave his spot, he dropped his pants answered nature's call right then and there. The stench of his droppings spread quickly throughout the line. One gentleman towards the front of the line caught its stench when he saw Bobby's creation, admiration spreading across his face. The man at the front of the line turned around and said ""that was a good shit post, but this punchline stinks.""",1

Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered ""nostalgia"" and he got downvoted into oblivion.Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie ""Up"". He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title ""STOLEN"".When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. ""How did you know that would win?"" ""Easy,"" Chris replied. ""Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes.""",1

One little boy stands up and offers, “if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in a field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that’d be a tragedy.”“Not quite”, says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.”A little girl raises her hand: “if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”“I’m afraid not,” explained the president. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. “Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? “Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, “If Air Force One, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.”“Fantastic!” exclaimed Mr. Trump. “That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”“Well’, said little Johnny, “because it sure as hell wouldn’t be a great loss and probably wouldn’t be an accident either.”",1

The professor continues to wrack his brain over the question all afternoon, but still can't get the answer. So finally he calls in a group of his brightest students and tells them he has a really, really tough question to answer, ""What is legal but not logical, logical but not legal, and neither logical nor legal? "" To the professor's surprise (and embarrassment), all the students immediately raise their hands. ""All right,"" says the professor and asks his favorite student to answer.""It's quite easy, sir"" says the student ""You see, you are 75 years old and married to a 30 year old woman, which is legal, but not logical. Your wife has a 22 year old lover, which is logical, but not legal. And your wife's lover failed his exam but you've just given him an ""A"", which is neither legal, nor logical.""",1

When he finally regained consciousness, he refocused his three eyes, straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien.  'He damn near killed me!

Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, ""How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!""At this, the Texan drawled, ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.""",1

It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” says the politician, “but I think I’d rather go to hell!” “Very well,” says the spirit. “Turn around.”When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago.

She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand... Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.. ""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said. Trembling, he did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots."" He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. ""Now take off my socks."" He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots. ""Now take off my skirt."" He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light. ""Now take off my bra.."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor. Then she looked at him and said, ""If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired."" ",1

He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

The bartender looks at the man and says, “What’ll ya have?” The man says, “Gimme a beer.” The ostrich says, “I’ll have one too.” The cat says, “I want two beers, but I’m only gonna pay half price.” The bartender serves up four beers, and tells the man, “that’ll be $12.67.” The man reaches in his pocket and without even looking sets exact change down on the bar. After they finish their beers, the bartender asks, “anything else?” The man says, “Gimme a shot of bourbon.” The ostrich says, “I’ll have one too.” The cat says, “I want a double bourbon, but I’m only gonna pay half price.” The bartender serves them and says, “That’s $14.03.” The man reaches into his pocket and without even looking again sets exact change on the bar. After that round, the bartender says, “What else will ya have?” The man says, “I need a Jack and Coke.” The ostrich says, “Me too!” The cat says, “I want two Jack and Cokes, and I’m only paying...” “Half price, I know,” says the bartender. He sets them up and says, “$16.38, please.” The man reaches in his pocket a third time, and again sets exact change on the bar without counting it out. The bartender asks the man, “How is it that every time you pay for your drink order, you can set exact change on the bar without looking?” The man says, “Well, some years ago I was walking on the beach in Egypt, and I found a magic lamp in the sand. I rubbed it, and a genie appeared and granted me three wishes for setting him free. So, with the first wish, I wished that no matter what I ever wanted to buy, I would always have exact change for it in my pocket.”The bartender says, “That’s brilliant! Most people would wish for a million or five million or whatever. This way, you’ll never run out of money, you don’t have to worry about carrying it, and you’ll never be robbed! Absolutely brilliant.”The man says, “I know, and thank you!”The bartender says, “So what did you ask for with your other two wishes?” The man said “A chick with long legs and a tight pussy.”",1

He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""The tramp blushed.The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...""For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95""The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said ""The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch. Among other things, we’re looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we’ll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay.We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.""",1

For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",1

When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.

There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 pebbles on the earth.”The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.",1

After a while the lizard says his mouth is ‘dry’, and that he’s going to get a drink from the river. At the riverbank, the lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls in. A Crocodile sees this and swims over to the stoned lizard, helping him to the side. He then asks the lizard, “What’s the matter with you?!” The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting in the tree, smoking a joint with his new monkey friend. He then explained how his mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a drink from the river, he fell in! The inquisitive crocodile says he has to check this out.

The plane touches down and is immediately surrounded by armed guards. The plane is impounded and the pilot is whisked off for questioning. The pilot claims that he had been flying from Las Vegas, gotten lost, and nearly run out of fuel, so he put his plane down at the first runway he saw. After extensive background checks, it is proven that the pilot isn't a spy and he is set to be released the following morning.Before he is allowed to leave, he is given the ""You didn't see anything"" talk, and is told that under absolutely no circumstances is he allowed to tell anyone where he was, or what he saw. The Air Force fuels up the man's plane, gives him a proper heading to get back to Las Vegas, and sends him on his way. Later that day, the man's plane is again spotted getting ready to land at Area 51. This time there are two people in the plane. When the plane touches down, it is immediately surrounded by guards again.

You’re not a monk.”The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk",1

Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. (Warning! Long one)_____Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available.  An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradiseFinally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong. The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:""I don't have a lighter""Edit: a wordSneak note: ITT a lot of people who wants to ruin the joke :(",1

He knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her screwing someone else._____So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.“Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a...” said the old man, and then he stopped.“Except what?” asked the businessman.“Nothing, nothing,” said the old man.“C’mon, tell me! I need something!” protested the businessman.“Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’” the old man said.“The voodoo dildo?” the businessman asked.The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!”The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.”He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo dildo, the door.”The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo dildo, box!”The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.The businessman said, “I’ll take it!”The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dildo, my pussy.”He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “Voodoo dildo, my pussy!” The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “Yeah, right. Voodoo dildo, my ass!""",1

""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...up and up...below him the ship grew smaller...on and on...past a solitary albatross...and still higher...till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...and on still further.../ till the ocean grew dim...and the earth itself...began to shrink...past our moon...and on...and Mars...and on...higher, and higher...through the asteroid belt...and on and on towards the diving board...past the outer planets, until...on the outermost reaches of the Solar System...he reached the board.He climbed on top and radioed the captain...and then....' '.. .. .he jumped.....:Slowly at first,:but speeding up,:::faster, and faster,:speeding past Pluto,:and the other outer planets,.........through the asteroid belt,past Mars,and the moon,faster,and faster,faster - ever faster,and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,faster, and faster,past the albatross,double-back somersault,and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!DOWN!DOWN!THROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!SMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!AND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!STILL DOWN...!DEEPER,DEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,TILL.........SMASH!Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.Up and up, desperate, gasping...Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""The tramp blushed.The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...""For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95""The captain outrageously asked why.The tramp said ""The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch. Among other things, we’re looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we’ll be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via gameplay.We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.""",1

He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.

The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom. And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides. ",1

""But we don't know how the French pray and we can't speak French!""The first guy thinks of a solution. ""We'll pick a guy in front of us, and whatever he does, we'll do.""His friend agrees. They enter the church, sit close to the front, and choose a guy.Fifteen minutes pass, and their plan is working well. Thirty minutes, no issues.By the time forty-five minutes pass, they've gotten used to the routine. Suddenly, while everyone is seated, the priest says something in French and the gentleman they chose stands up. Without thinking, the two Americans stand up as well.The church bursts into hard laughter.Realizing that no one else is standing up, the two American men leave in embarrassment. They wait for the Mass to end, and then approach the priest, who spoke English.""We're well-meaning people- we don't speak French and just chose some guy to imitate while praying,"" one says.The priest chuckles.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",1

For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.Why am I telling you all of this back story? Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.",1
